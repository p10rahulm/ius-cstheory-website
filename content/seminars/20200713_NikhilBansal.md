<b>Abstract:</b>
Consider the setting where vectors in [-1,1]^n  arrive online, and upon the arrival of vector v_t at time t, it must be immediately and irrevocably assigned a sign +1 or -1. The goal is to pick these signs to ensure that the norm of the signed sum of these vectors stays small.

Such online discrepancy games were originally considered by Spencer in the 70's, but have received renewed attention due to applications in online algorithms.  I will give an overview of the results and techniques in the area and describe several new recent results (after the STOC 2020 paper)  that obtain close to optimal bounds in many general settings such as for the online version of Komlos and Banaszczyk problems.

Based on joint works with Joel Spencer, Haotian Jiang, Raghu Meka, Sahil Singla and Makrand Sinha.
