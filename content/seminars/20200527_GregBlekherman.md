<b>Abstract:</b>
A graph profile of a k-tuple of connected graphs records all possible densities of the k-tuple in all graphs.
For instance an edge-triangle profile consists of (the closure of) all pairs of points in the plane that give edge
density and triangle density of a graph. A graph profile captures many quantities of interest in extremal combinatorics.
Unfortunately graph profiles can be extremely complicated, and a full profile is not known for any triple of
connected graphs.
<br><br>
I will review some known results about graph profiles and introduce some tools for studying them. The first tool is a
sum of squares method (also known as Cauchy-Schwartz calculus). The second tool is tropicalization, which is a
well-studied operation in algebraic geometry involving logarithmic image of the set. Tropicalization of a graph profile
is a closed convex cone, which still captures interesting combinatorial information. Tropicalizations are simpler objects,
for instance they can be computed for arbitrary tuples of complete and star graphs (and regular hypergraphs).
I will state some open questions and explain how tropicalization can be used to prove strong limitations on the
power of sums of squares method.
