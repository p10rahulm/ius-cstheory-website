We will survey some recent results that exploit the Lee-Yang theory of
phase transitions in order to give new deterministic approximation
algorithms for the partition functions of various spin systems.  A main
ingredient in the use of these methods is to understand the location of
the complex roots of the partition functions being studied, even when
one is only interested in the "physical" case that often corresponds to
positive and real values of the parameters.
<br><br>
We will mainly discuss applications to the ferromagnetic Ising and
anti-ferromagnetic Potts models on bounded degree graphs, including the
special case of proper colourings.  In both these cases, we will show
how these methods yield deterministic algorithms in a region of the
parameter space which had remained inaccessible to traditional methods
such as decay of correlations (and, in some cases, also to randomized
methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo).
<br><br>
We will also briefly survey other applications of the method, including
the work of Barvinok and Patel and Regts which provided some of the
first examples, and close with some evidence of how these methods might
still be intimately connected with correlation decay and Markov chain
Monte Carlo.

This talk is based on joint papers with Jingcheng Liu and Alistair
Sinclair.
