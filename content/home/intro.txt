Different aspects of the geometry of polynomials have come to play increasingly important
roles in combinatorics, discrete probability and the theory of algorithms, with resolutions of old
open problems and other exciting new developments in these areas having drawn on this set of ideas.
~~~
The center seeks to work on some key open questions in diverse fields: including in computational
statistics, operations research, algorithmic game theory, Markov chain Monte Carlo,
the mathematical theory of convex optimization, and algorithmic aspects of statistical physics.
A common theme running through this diverse set of questions is that for all of them, there is
compelling evidence to suggest that ideas from the geometry of polynomials are likely to constitute
an important piece of the puzzle.
~~~
The center will facilitate research on the new and exciting topic of Polynomials as an Algorithmic
Paradigm. The virtual center will support collaboration between the faculty and students from the
involved universities as well as workshops and online seminars. This Indo-US virtual center seeks
to bring together several researchers in India and the USA whose work touches upon different facets
of this subject.
